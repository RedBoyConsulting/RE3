Quick Note on the Controls
    1. When manually changing the keys in "Controls" in the OPTION window 
       (Press F5 to display this window), please be careful not to assign two or 
       more keys to the same function. E.g. Assigning "forward" and "view map" to 
       the same key. 

    2. Please note that the key "M" can also be used to skip the door animation in 
       the game. For joypad users, the default key to skip the door animation is "X" 
       button. Lastly, when the map is displayed on the screen and if you have 
       more than one map in your possession, you can use press the "M" key again 
       to display the list of map you posses. Press the "Enter" key to view the
       selected map.

Windows 95a Users and OLE Error Message
    I installed Resident Evil 3 on my Windows 95 computer but when I
    click "Run Resident Evil 3" from the launcher, an error message 
    relating to "OLE" is displayed on the screen and the game would not 
    run at all.

    You may have an older version of Windows 95. After starting Windows 95, 
    please right-click your mouse on "My Computer" icon usually located on the 
    upper left-hand corner of the screen. A menu will be displayed on the icon. 
    From the menu, click "Properties" to display the Properties Window. In this 
    window, you will see a heading called "System" under the "General" tab. Under 
    this heading, if it says "Microsoft Windows 95 4.00.950a" then, it would mean 
    that you have an older version of Windows 95. If this is the case, Internet 
    Explorer 4.0 or greater must be installed before playing Resident Evil 3 on your 
    computer. This is because; the older version of Windows 95 lacks certain 
    components that the newer Windows 95 and 98 have to run advanced 
    applications such as Resident Evil 3. By installing Internet Explorer 4.0 or 
    greater, these components missing from the older version of Windows 95 is 
    installed into Windows 95. Thus, allowing the computer to run more advanced
    applications.
    
Memory and Performance
    The game requires at least 64MB of RAM.
    Regardless of how much memory you have, you can maximise your available
    memory and increase the overall performance of the game engine by doing the 
    following:
    -  Closing any open windows
    -  Shutting down all other programs, including menu-bar programs like ICQ
    -  Defragmenting your hard drive

Preparing Your Hard Drive
    To ensure that your installation is trouble free, you should check to see that 
    your hard drive and file system are both tuned for optimum performance. 
    Windows 95/98 comes with two utility programs that find and fix any errors 
    and optimise your hard drive's performance. The first of these programs is 
    called scandisk. Scandisk will check your hard drive for problems and can fix 
    any that it finds. You can run scandisk by clicking on the START button from 
    the Windows 95/98 Taskbar, followed by Programs, then Accessories, then 
    System Tools, and finally scandisk.

    Once scandisk has finished running, you should next optimise your hard 
    drive's performance by running a program called Disk Defragmenter.. You 
    can run Disk Defragmenter by clicking on the START button from the 
    Windows 95/98 desktop, followed by Programs, then Accessories, then 
    System Tools, and finally Disk Defragmenter.


Crashes and Lock-Ups
    When I start Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS, my mouse cursor disappears 
    and my computer locks-up.

    Chances are your installed audio card drivers are not compatible with DirectX. 
    The only solution is to get a DirectX 6.1 compatible driver from your audio 
    card manufacturer.

    The Installer keeps stopping when a certain percentage is complete, 
    so I can't install Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS.

    There are three likely causes:

     1) You may have run out of free space on your hard drive. 
= "
     2) Files are possibly being copied to a corrupted area of your hard drive. If 
    this is so, you'll need to run the scandisk program and make sure to use the 
    Thorough option (see previous). After scandisk has finished running and has 
    informed you that your drive is free of errors, try to re-install. 
    
     3) There may be dirt or fingerprints on the CD-ROM disc itself. Examine the 
    bottom of the disc; if you see any fingerprints or dirt, carefully clean the disc 
    using a clean, soft, lint-free cloth by wiping from the centre of the disc (near 
    the hole) towards the outer edge in a straight line.
    
    Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS is crashing to the desktop with no error 
    messages.
    
    Several different things can cause this problem. Here's a list of the most 
    common culprits associated with these crashes:
    
     1) Make sure the CD-ROM is clean (check for both scratches and smudges 
        on the reading surface of the CD). 
    	
     2) Make sure the game has been installed properly. 
    	
     3) Make sure DirectX 6.1 has been installed properly. 
    	
     4) Make sure you have the latest Windows 95/98 drivers for your video 
        card and that they are DirectX 6.1-compatible. 
    	
     5) Make sure you have the latest Windows 95/98 drivers for your sound 
        card and that they are DirectX 6.1-compatible. 
    	
     6) Make sure Virtual Memory is enabled on your system. 
    	
     7) Run scandisk. 
    	
     8) Run Disk Defragmenter. 
    	
     9) Clean out old temp (.TMP) files from the C:\WINDOWS\TEMP or 
        C:\WIN95\TEMP directory on your hard drive (from Windows Explorer). 
    	
    10) Make sure you do not have any Anti-Virus utilities (like Norton's 
        AntiVirus) running resident prior to playing Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS.
    	
    11) Make sure you do not have any 3rd party Windows 95/98 memory 
        management utilities (like QuarterDeck's QEMM 8.0 for Windows 95) 
        running resident prior to playing Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS. 
    	
    12) Make sure you do not have any 3rd party Windows 95/98 disk caching 
        utilities running resident prior to playing Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS. 
    	
    13) Make sure you do not have Norton's Crash Protector running resident 
        prior to playing Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS 
    
    14) Try uninstalling and then reinstalling the game. 
    
    15)Try exiting the game, rebooting your machine, and re-entering the 
        game.
    
    Note that if your system crashes to the desktop while playing Resident Evil 3 
    NEMESIS, you should reboot your computer before starting a new play 
    session.  Otherwise, DirectDraw or DirectSound may be in a locked state, and 
    the game will be unable to use your sound or video hardware.


Controller Problems
    Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS can take input from both joypads and from the 
    keyboard. The functions of keys are defined in the manual. All joypads to be 
    used in the game must be connected before the game is started. Adding or 
    removing controllers while the game is in play may well make the game crash.
    
    My Controller doesn't seem to work 
    
    Make sure that the controller is represented in the Game Controllers option on 
    the Control Panel. If the controller isn't listed add the controller using the add 
    button. If the controller is listed as not connected then you may need to move 
    the controller to the first position in the list or install a new set of drivers for 
    the controller.
    
    The Game Continually scrolls through options.
    
    This is because your controller hasn't been calibrated or a controller was 
    removed while the game was in play. To calibrate your controller go to Game 
    Controllers option on the Control Panel and select the controller's properties. 
    Hit the calibrate button and follow the instructions for your controller.
    
    The Default Controller Configuration has changed 
    
    Adding or removing controllers may effect the order of saved controller 
    configurations (they are saved along with the options file). To reset a 
    controller configuration, go to the controller screen and set the controller 
    configuration to default.

AutoPlay Issues
    Why doesn't the AutoPlay feature come up when I insert the 
    Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS CD into the CD-ROM drive?
    
    This is usually a configuration issue. There are many different ways to enable 
    the AutoPlay functions of Windows 95/98. The standard method is described 
    below: 
    
    1)Enter the Windows 95/98 CONTROL PANEL from the desktop by clicking 
      on the START button, followed by SETTINGS, and then CONTROL 
      PANEL.
    2)Double-click the icon labelled SYSTEM, usually located alphabetically 
      towards the bottom of the Control Panel window, to bring up the System 
      Properties panel.
    3)Click on the tab at the top labelled Device Manager and when the new 
      panel appears, locate the section labelled CD-ROM and click the PLUS 
      (+) sign in front of it. (If there is a minus sign in front, don't click it.) 
    4)Now double-click the CD-ROM drive revealed and the CD-ROM Properties 
      panel will appear.
    5)Click on the Settings tab at the top. 
    6)Towards the middle of the panel, you should see a few checkboxes within 
      the Options section. At the bottom of that section, you should see a 
      checkbox labelled Auto insert notification. 
    7)Make sure there is a check mark in the box provided and click on the OK 
      button to complete the process. 
    
    
DirectX 6.1
    The game uses Microsoft's DirectX 6.1. In order for you to play the game, you 
    must have DX6.1 -compliant drivers for your video card and sound card.  
    Please note that although DirectX 6.1 is installed with the game, your video 
    and sound card drivers will not be upgraded to DirectX 6.1 drivers. You will 
    need to obtain the latest DX6.1 drivers from your card manufacturer.
    
    
    DirectX-Related Questions
      How do I know which version of DirectX I have? Will it run with 
	     an older version? And if I do, indeed, have an older version of 
      DirectX, where can I get the latest one?

      How do I manually install the DirectX drivers?
      Help! Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS has hosed my system, and I 
      suspect that DirectX is the culprit. How can I restore my original 
      drivers?

      Ahh! I cannot use DirectX on my computer! Is there any other way 
      to run Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS?
    
    
DirectX Version

    How do I know which version of DirectX I have? Will it run with an 
    older version? And if I do, indeed, have an older version of DirectX, 
    where can I get the latest one?
    
    The Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS installer will do its best to auto-detect which 
    version of DirectX currently resides on your system, and then prompt you for 
    any necessary changes. DirectX 6.1 is the latest version of DirectX. This is 
    the version that comes with Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS and was thoroughly 
    tested with it. Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS REQUIRES DirectX 6.1 to play.  
    You cannot play if you have an older version installed.
    	
    
Run Without DirectX?
    
    I cannot use DirectX on my computer! Is there any other way to run 
    Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS? 
    
    If you do not have DirectX installed on your computer, you WILL NOT be able 
    to run Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS.
    
    
Graphic Correction Options
    The blood looks blocky!
    
    If you experience blocky graphics around some objects such as water droplets 
    and blood, this can be fixed by selecting F5, then `Others`. There is an option 
    labelled `Voodoo2` selecting this should fix the problem. (If you own a 
    Voodoo Video Card.)
    
    Lines appear across screen at 640x480 resolution (or above)!
    
    If the user changes resolution of the game to 640x480 (or above) and 
    experiences a series of lines appearing on screen, this can fixed by selecting 
    F5 then `Others`. There is an option labelled `Texture Correction`. If this is 
    highlighted and problem exists, un-highlight the option to fix, and vice versa.
